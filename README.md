## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid areas
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

I am getting more comfortable with Sass. I found another advantage except for that css is neatly organized. I think it is great to have custom variables in a separate file, I don't have to scroll up and down all the time. There was a lot of custom variables in this challenge, many font sizes and colors.

### Continued development

I would like to use @mixins and other features of Sass.

### Useful resources

- I only checked the syntax for [drop-shadow()](https://www.example.com) on MDN this time.
